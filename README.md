# maps-fs
View your location on Flight Simulator 2020 in Google Maps.
Created this because of the limitations of the in-game map for more remote areas (and because the map is overall incomplete).

## How to use
- Download a release in the "releases" section, unzip it, and run MapsSim.exe.
- Access the URL given to you in a browser on any computer (or cellphone) inside your network.
- To zoom/move the map, disable the "Track" checkbox.

## Made with
- Good ol' .NET Framework and C#
- MSFS2020 SDK and SimConnect
- EmbedIO webServer
- WebSockets and vanilla.js
- Google Maps API
